# YGOCard

The CardShop class in this code provides a mechanism to read and manage a collection of Yu-Gi-Oh! cards from a CSV file. This class is equipped with methods to load card data from a CSV file, display card information, sort cards by attack or defense values using various sorting algorithms, and compare two CardShop instances for equality based on their card collections.

The CardShop constructor takes the name of an input file in CSV format, reads the card data, and creates instances of YGOCard objects based on the file's contents. Each YGOCard object represents a Yu-Gi-Oh! card with attributes such as name, type, level/rank, race, attribute, attack, and defense.

The DoublyLinkedList class in this code is a versatile data structure that provides functionality for managing a list of items with efficient insertion, removal, and traversal operations. It allows bidirectional traversal, meaning you can move forward and backward within the list. 

The YGOCard class represents a Yu-Gi-Oh! trading card and encapsulates various attributes and behaviors associated with these cards. This class is designed to store and manage information about Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, including their name, type, level/rank, race, attribute, attack (Atk) value, and defense (Def) value.
